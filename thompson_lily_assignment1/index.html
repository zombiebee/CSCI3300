        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>I enjoy photography, art, playing video games, and listening to music. 
        Recently I have been obsessed with Deltarune since chapter 2 came out a bit ago. 
        I like the game's music, and it has inspired me to do more art, too. For photography, 
        I like taking photos of flowers and nature stuff in the Spring.

        <h1>Family</h1>
        <p>I am the eldest child in my family. I have 2 younger siblings, 
            and I share a dorm with one this year. We have 3 cats and a dog. 
            My youngest sibling is a Sophomore in high school. My mom 
            recently went to college to get an Associates (when I was in high 
            school). Because of this and since my dad's highest level of 
            education is high school, my siblings and I are first generation 
            college students.
