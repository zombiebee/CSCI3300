        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>I enjoy photography, art, playing video games, &amp; listening to music. 
        Recently I have been obsessed with <i>Deltarune&trade;</i> since chapter 2 came out a bit ago. 
        I like the game's music, and it has inspired me to do more art, too. For photography, 
        I like taking photos of <b>flowers</b> and <b>nature</b> stuff in the Spring.
        </p>

        <h1>Family</h1>
        <p>I am the <i>eldest</i> child in my family. I have 2 younger siblings, 
            and I share a dorm with one this year. We have 3 cats and a dog. 
            My youngest sibling is a <b>Sophomore</b> in high school. My mom 
            recently went to college to get an Associates (when I was in high 
            school). Because of this and since my dad's highest level of 
            education is high school, my siblings and I are first generation 
            college students.
        </p>

        <h1>Video Games</h1>
        <p>I'm running out of ideas for things to talk about, so I'm gonna mention some
            video games I like. I mostly enjoy <b>Nintendo</b> games like <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>. I 
            also like rpgs like <i>Chrono Trigger</i> and <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i>. I am not very 
            good at the more difficult games, but I've gotten a lot better at <i>Hollow Knight</i>, 
            and while I think horror rpgs are also neat, I am too much of a wimp to play 
            them myself.            
        </p>
