    <h1>Music</h1>
    <p>
      Next, I guess I'll talk about music I like. I think I mentioned before,
      it's mostly video game music. Not always games I've played but usually. I
      have several Undertale tracks on my playlists along with Zelda, Touhou,
      Kirby, Paper Mario, and Xenoblade are a few. I also listen to some
      Vocaloid.
